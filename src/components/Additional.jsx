        <p className="max-w-[1200px] mx-auto lg:text-[18px] text-[#808080] text-center  mt-8">I should rather say our achievements! The reason being none of them would be possible without a team. So, as a team, we have won <span className="text-[var(--color-5)] font-semibold">two hackathons</span>: one online and one offline.</p>
        <p className="max-w-[1200px] mx-auto lg:text-[18px] text-[#808080] text-center  mt-8"> To be precise, in one of the events, we created a platform where farmers can check if their plant is diseased. They can simply upload an image of the leaf of the plant, and our ML model, trained on neural networks, makes predictions based on the trained datasets to determine if the plant is diseased.</p>
        <p className="max-w-[1200px] mx-auto lg:text-[18px] text-[#808080] text-center  mt-8">Not just the ML model; as I said, we love building products. We went further with this project and built a fully functional product that allows users not only to check if the plant is diseased but also to chat in the communities with a built-in community system. Here, they can engage with people and learn more about the information they want. We also implemented a blogging system that allows authorized users to create blog posts and added many more features."</p>
